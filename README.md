Three goals:

1. A parsing library that's pleasant enough to use;

2. that's simple to adapt or rewrite from scratch if I'm faced with
some new situation like a new programming language;

3. that inexpert programmers can follow without too much pain. 

So I aimed for one page of clear code not using combinators. There's
also a combinator library using similar ideas (compromising on goal
3), not checked in here so far.

See https://github.com/darius/sketchbook/tree/master/parsing
for some early sketches.
